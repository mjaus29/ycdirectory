## üåê Live Site

üöÄ Here is a working live site: [ycdirectory.markaustria.com](https://ycdirectory.markaustria.com/)

üóíÔ∏è Check out the case study here: [markaustria.com/ycdirectory](https://www.markaustria.com/ycdirectory)

## üìù Description

Welcome to YC Directory! A modern full-stack Next.js application designed as a pitching platform for users to share and discover startup ideas.

YC Directory allows users to create, share, and discover startup ideas with real-time updates. The application features GitHub authentication, content management via Sanity, and implements advanced rendering strategies like Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR).

This application solves the challenge of creating a responsive platform with proper authentication flow, real-time content updates, and optimized rendering strategies while maintaining excellent performance and SEO benefits.

**Technologies Used**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, NextAuth, Sanity, Sentry, Zod

## ‚ú® Features

- **Partial Pre-Rendering Implementation**: Combines static and dynamic rendering within the same page. Static content like startup details are cached while dynamic elements like view counters are rendered server-side in real-time.

- **Real-Time Content Updates**: Integrated Sanity's live content API to deliver real-time updates without page refreshes. When users submit new startups, they appear instantly on the homepage for all users.

- **Advanced Form Handling with React**: Leveraged React's new useActionState hook and Next.js server actions to create a robust form submission system with built-in validation using Zod.

- **GitHub Authentication**: Implemented custom callbacks in the NextAuth configuration to create or fetch Sanity author documents upon successful GitHub authentication.
